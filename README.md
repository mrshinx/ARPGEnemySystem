# ARPG Enemy System Mod for Terraria
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3027691283
## What this mod does
This mod was originally created to address a problem that I have always had while playing modded Terraria, with RPG mods to be specific: Enemy scaling.

Most of the time, RPG mods made for Terraria only add power up for player in form of stat, skill, weapon upgrade,... but rarely do it for the enemies, leading to a very frustrating experience that at some point the player would outscale everything and could just cheese through the game. Some RPG mods do try to address this issue but I have not been able to find anything that is properly done, at least for my taste.

From this reason, I came up with this mod in hope of having a more balanced playthrough. The mod itself adds a scaling system for enemies in form of level, modifier, rank and that's it. It does not provide any RPG modification to the player, thus everyone can use this mod along with their favorite RPG mod. 

## Features
- Enemies now have level. For each downed boss they become stronger.
- Enemies now have modifiers that give them special power like siphoning player's mana on hit. (bosses excluded)
- Enemies now have ranks that boost their stat accordingly. (bosses excluded)
- Compatible with Multiplayer.
- All features are fully customizable.
- HIGHLY COMPATIBLE WITH OTHER MODDED CONTENT. Modded enemies are able to benefit from the scaling and modded bosses also count toward enemy level.
